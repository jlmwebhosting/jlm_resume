      <p>Summary
I am a web developer familiar with the fundamentals of MVC and TDD, and constantly pursuing my passion to continuously learn new languages, frameworks and techniques in order to become a better computer programmer. I have always been drawn to tech in all its forms, and over the last 15 years, I've dabbled in many different programming languages and web development/publishing platforms. What really excites me about programming is the near-constant sense of working on an elaborate puzzle, and the great satisfaction that comes when all the pieces fit together and the final picture appears.</p>
