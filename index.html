      <p>Summary
I am a junior developer familiar with the fundamentals of MVC and BDD, and constantly pursuing my passion to continuously learn new languages, frameworks and techniques in order to become a better computer programmer. I have always been drawn to tech in all its forms, and over the last year, I've dabbled in many different programming languages and web development platforms. What really excites me about programming is the near-constant sense of working on an elaborate puzzle, and the great satisfaction that comes when all the pieces fit together and the final picture appears.</p>
