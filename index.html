      <p>Summary
I am a junior developer familiar with the fundamentals of MVC and BDD, and constantly pursuing my passion to continuously learn new languages, frameworks and techniques in order to become a better computer programmer. I have always been drawn to tech in all its forms, and over the last year, I've dabbled in many different programming languages and web development platforms. What really excites me about programming is the near-constant sense of working on an elaborate puzzle, and the great satisfaction that comes when all the pieces fit together and the final picture appears.</p>

Drupal modules and templates using PHP, write JavaScript and jQuery code from scratch, apply look &amp; feel styling using
Compass/SASS, and build code to integrate with internalsystems. You will collaborate daily with project

triage and quick resolution will be needed for any reported site issues.
Create a new PHP site template and write CSS from scratch to show a schedule of games.
Create responsive pages that include editorial content, ads, and pre-built site components.
Create a new editorial form in Drupal for publishing stories, photos, or video.

PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, JSON/XML are required.
Experience with responsive designs and basic Unix commands is preferred.
Writing custom modules or plugins for Drupal and Wordpress as a back-end CMS is a plus.
